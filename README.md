fireflyMvSettings
=================

This is a little openframeworks application for manually controlling the settings of the Firefly MV camera on xcode.

It lets manually set the exposure, shutter speed, brightness, gamma and gain programatically.

It needs ofxUi addon and ofxLibdc addon

Thanks pappis for the help given in the openframeworks forum.
