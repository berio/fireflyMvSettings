fireflyMvSettings
=================

This is a little openframeworks application for manually controlling the settings of the [Firefly MV camera](http://ww2.ptgrey.com/IEEE-1394/fireflymv) on xcode.

It lets manually set the exposure, shutter speed, brightness, gamma and gain programatically.

It needs ofxUi addon and [ofxLibdc addon](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxLibdc)

Thanks pappis for the help given in the [openframeworks forum] (http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/control-video-settings-of-firefly-mv-on-mac/15495/2).
